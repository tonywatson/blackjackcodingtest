Coding Test creating a BlackJack game in Ruby

In Command Line, simply type ruby game.rb

Currently hardcoded for one deck and one player, but has function to handle more of either

# Still needs
- Accept "hold" response and perform necessary actions, where dealer shows card and decides to hit or not
- Once deck is exhausted, ends game and determines winner based on points
- Allow input for more than one player
- Allow input for more than one deck
